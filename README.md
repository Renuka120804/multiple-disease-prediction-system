<h1>Multiple Disease Predictor System  </h1>
An application capable of diagnosing the probability of three diseases, namely Heart Disease, Diabetes and Parkinson’s. Built in Anaconda’s IDE Spyder, the application incorporates machine learning algorithms into the model to make a more precise prediction of health. 

<h3>Features</h3>  
•	Conducts prediction of Heart Disease Diabetes and Parkinson’s disease with the help of respective datasets.<br>    
•	Has a simple interface oriented towards human use developed using the Tkinter library. <br>    
•	Furnishes performance measures such as, accuracy, confusion matrix as well as graphs depicting feature importance. <br>    
•	Created for early detection & preventive medicine.  <br>    

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
•	Programming Language: Python.  <br>   
•	IDE: Anaconda’s Spyder.  <br>   
Libraries:   <br>  
•	Pandas: Data manipulation.   <br>
